# NuGet package - Selenium WebDriver PhantomJS

[![NuGet Package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Selenium.WebDriver.PhantomJS.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver.PhantomJS/)

## Selenium.WebDriver.PhantomJS

This NuGet package installs PhantomJS into the bin directory of your Selenium Unit Test project. This project is heavily inspired by and borrows from the [Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver](https://github.com/jsakamoto/nupkg-selenium-webdriver-chromedriver/) project.

## Getting Started

Just add this nuget package to your test project and it will copy PhantomJS to the bin folder during the build process. This way, there is no need to commit PhantomJS.exe to your source control repository.

## Installing

At the package manager console on Visual Studio, enter following command:

    PM> Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.PhantomJS
